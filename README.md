# Django Job Board
Django Job Board is a web application built using the Django web framework that allows users to post and search for jobs. It is designed to be a simple, easy-to-use platform for both job seekers and employers.

## Features
- Employers can create a profile and post job openings, including details such as the job title, location, salary, and required qualifications.
- Job seekers can search for jobs using keywords and filters, and apply to openings by submitting their resume and cover letter.
- The application includes a built-in messaging system that allows employers and job seekers to communicate with each other directly.
- User dashboard allows users to manage their job search and application process.
